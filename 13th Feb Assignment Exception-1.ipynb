    "# 13th Feb Assignment Question Exception -1\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q1.Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: The Exception class is the base class for all built-in exceptions in Python. When creating a \n",
    "custom exception, it is important to inherit from the Exception class so that the custom exception \n",
    "can be caught and handled properly. This allows us to create a hierarchy of exceptions that can be \n",
    "used to catch and handle different types of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheriting from the Exception class also allows us to use the built-in exception handling mechanisms \n",
    "in Python, such as try/except blocks and the raise statement. This makes it easier to create robust \n",
    "error handling code that can be used to handle different types of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, inheriting from the Exception class allows us to create custom exceptions that are compatible \n",
    "with the existing exception handling mechanisms in Python. This makes it easier to integrate our custom \n",
    "exceptions into existing code without having to rewrite large portions of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q2.Write a python program to print Python Exception Hierarchy.\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: # import inspect module\n",
    "import inspect\n",
    "  \n",
    "# our pwskills function\n",
    "def pwskills(cls, j = 0):\n",
    "    \n",
    "      # print name of the class\n",
    "    print ('-' * j, cls.__name__)\n",
    "      \n",
    "    # iterating through subclasses\n",
    "    for i in cls.__subclasses__():\n",
    "        pwskills(i, j + 3)\n",
    "  \n",
    "print(\"Hierarchy for Built-in exceptions is : \")\n",
    "  \n",
    "# inspect.getmro() Return a tuple \n",
    "# of class  cls’s base classes.\n",
    "  \n",
    "# building a tree hierarchy \n",
    "inspect.getclasstree(inspect.getmro(BaseException))\n",
    "  \n",
    "# function call\n",
    "treeClass(BaseException)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q3. What errors are defined in the ArithmeticError class? Explain any two with an example.\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: The ArithmeticError class is a built-in Python exception class that is raised when an error occurs \n",
    "in an arithmetic operation. The errors defined in the ArithmeticError class are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. OverflowError: This error is raised when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum \n",
    "limit for a numeric type. For example, if you try to add two numbers that are too large to fit in an \n",
    "integer, an OverflowError will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ZeroDivisionError: This error is raised when a number is divided by zero. For example, if you try to \n",
    "divide a number by zero, a ZeroDivisionError will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q4. Why LookupError class is used? Explain with an example KeyError and IndexError.\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: LookupError is a class used to represent errors that occur when attempting to access an item in a \n",
    "data structure that does not exist. It is the parent class of two other classes, KeyError & IndexError. \n",
    "\n",
    "KeyError is raised when a key is not found in a dictionary. For example, if you try to access a key \n",
    "that does not exist in a dictionary, you will get a KeyError:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Trying to access a key that does not exist\n",
    "print(my_dict['c'])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output: KeyError: 'c'\n",
    "\n",
    "IndexError is raised when an index is not found in a sequence. For example, if you try to access an \n",
    "index that does not exist in a list, you will get an IndexError:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Trying to access an index that does not exist\n",
    "print(my_list[3])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output: IndexError: list index out of range\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q5. Explain ImportError. What is ModuleNotFoundError?\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: ImportError is an exception raised when a module or package cannot be found. It is usually raised \n",
    "when the import statement fails to locate the module, or when an imported module attempts to import a \n",
    "module that cannot be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "ModuleNotFoundError is a subclass of ImportError that is raised when a module cannot be found. It's \n",
    "usually raised when the import statement fails to locate the module, or when an imported module \n",
    "attempts to import a module that cannot be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q6. List down some best practices for exception handling in python.\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "1. \"Use try-except blocks:\" Try-except blocks are the most common way to handle exceptions in Python.\n",
    "They allow you to catch and handle errors gracefully, without crashing your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"Use the finally block:\" The finally block is used to execute code regardless of whether an exception \n",
    "is raised or not. This is useful for cleaning up resources, such as closing files or database connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \"Use logging:\" Logging is a great way to keep track of errors and other events in your program. It can \n",
    "help you debug issues and identify potential problems before they become major issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. \"Don’t ignore exceptions:\" Ignoring exceptions is a bad practice and can lead to unexpected behavior \n",
    "in your program. Always make sure to handle exceptions properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. \"Use custom exceptions:\" Custom exceptions are a great way to add more context to errors  and make \n",
    "them easier to debug. They also allow you to create more specific error messages that are tailored to your application. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
